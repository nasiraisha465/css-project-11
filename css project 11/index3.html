        <h1>about my family</h1>
        <p>so... in the previous page i talked about my self, but in this page i'll talk about my family. my family
            consist of me, my mom and dad. but the twist is that we don't live together and my parents are no longer
            together. so i currently live with my mom in nigeria and my dad lives alone in sweden as i mentioned in 
            the previous page. its been quite a long time my mom and dad broke up with each other... and sometimes 
            when i think about it, it makes me sad. and each time i ask my mom why they are no longer together she 
            says that i was my dad's fault for them not beeing together. and when i ask my dad the same think he blames
            it on my mom, so it's hard for me to procces somrtimes. but although they are not more together i equally 
            love them so much. in my mom's side of the family i have a lot of cousines that i can't count them, while 
            in my dad;s side of the family i have 5 cousins and they are all boys... and i love the sooo much. and also 
            my dad is the breadwinner of the family, while my mom is the second born of the family... and tha's it about 
            my family
